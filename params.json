Any other distros or custom builds of FFMPEG\r\nmay not be supported.  If ScreenStudio does not work on your distro (or custom build), download the source code of\r\nScreenStudio to adjust the proper command to use with FFMpeg.\r\n\r\nNOTE2:  An OSX version will be coming soon for version 2.

For local recording, select any file format.  For live streaming,\r\nselect any service like Twitch or Youtube.\r\n\r\nFor live streaming, you will have to select a server and enter your magic key in the opening dialog.\r\n\r\nSelect the desired profile.  By default, \"DISPLAY\" is selected, meaning that the output will match the display size of your computer.  Other supported formats are: 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p.\r\n\r\nScreenStudio will calculate to output format size based on your selection so that the width will be adjusted to the selected\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nYour current configuration is displayed in the \"Configuration\" display.\r\n\r\n- SOURCES\r\n\r\nThe SOURCES will let you select the different sources to use for a local recording or a live streaming:\r\n- Display: If you have more than 1 display, select the proper display to use\r\n- Webcam: Select the proper webcam to use.  \"None\" will not use any webcam.\r\n- Microphone:  Select the microphone (audio input) to use.\r\n- Internal:  Select the internal audio monitor to use.  This is the input that will be used to capture the audio from your computer\r\n- Webcam Title: A text that will be displayed at the top of your webcam.\r\n- Debug mode:  When activated, the console will show all the output from FFMpeg.\r\n\r\n- PANEL\r\n\r\nThis is where you configure your side panel.\r\n- Panel:  Select the panel overlay you wish to use.  This is a list of the files found in the \"Overlays\" sub-folder\r\n- Panel Width:  Set the with of the panel overlay to use.  It should match the width of your webcam format for best results\r\n- Duration:  Enter your expected streaming duration.  This is used with Overlays to display the remaining time.\r\n\r\n- PANEL AND OVERLAYS\r\n\r\nSupported file format are :\r\n- *.txt : Basic text file\r\n- *.html: Simple HTML file (HTML4) are supported.\r\n- *.url:  A URL to be used to display content instead of a local HTML file.\r\n\r\nHTML file are the best of showing content in your recording/live streaming.  Use any text editor to create your own overlay\r\nusing basic HTML tags.  Javascript is not supported.  For more dynamic content, your can use a URL file to load content\r\nfrom a web server.\r\n\r\nThe HTML rendering do support some basic styles CSS but do not expect a full HTML5 support.  Here's an example:\r\n\r\n<html>\r\n<body bgcolor=white color=black with=320 height=800>\r\n<H1>ScreenStudio is amazing!</H1>\r\n<font color=red>Download now!</font>\r\n</body\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nIn the \"BODY\" tag, set the background and foreground color.  To ensure that the overlay will use all the available space,\r\nset the width and height also in the body tag.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ for a list of tags to use...\r\n\r\n- PANEL CONTENT TAGS\r\n\r\nIn the text/html content, some tags are supported to udate the text content with values like the current date and time.\r\n\r\n\t@CURRENTDATE (Current date)\r\n\t@CURRENTTIME (Current time)\r\n \t@RECORDINGTIME (Recording time in minutes)\r\n\t@STARTTIME (Time when the recording started)\r\n\t@REMAININGTIME (Time remaining in minutes)\r\n\t@TEXT (Custom text from the text entry in the Panel tab...)\r\n\r\n\r\n- AUDIO INPUT:\r\nScreenStudio is relying on Pulseaudio for audio recording.  When two audio input are selected (Mic+Internal), ScreenStudio will\r\nadd a virtual audio input that will mix both Mic and Internal audio input.  This virtual audio input will only exists while\r\nScreenStudio is capturing and will be remove once the capture is completed.\r\n\r\nTo adjust the audio levels, use the default audio mixer or install \"pavucontrol\" for more options.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCONTACT:\r\n\r\nMain website: http://screenstudio.crombz.com\r\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/patrickballeux\r\nG+ Community: https://plus.google.com/communities/107164189448403990139\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that ScreenStudio is free and that I work on this project in my spare time.\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nPatrick\r\n\r\n",
